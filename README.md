# lidar_interface

This Robot Operating System (ROS) package is my work at interfacing with the Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR for my master's thesis on LiDAR-based SLAM.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Linux Operating System (preferrably Ubuntu 16.04)
[Velodyne VLP-16](https://velodynelidar.com/products/puck/) - The LIDAR in question.

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
